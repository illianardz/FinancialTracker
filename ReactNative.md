# Downloading React Native

React Native is a JavaScript framework used to build cross-platform mobile applications for iOS and Android. We chose React Native for its ability to allow developers to write code once and deploy it across multiple platforms, saving time and resources.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (Download from [Node.js Official Site](https://nodejs.org/))
- npm or yarn (comes with Node.js installation)
- React Native CLI (Install with `npm install -g react-native-cli`)

## Set Up React Native
1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Install React Native CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
```
3. Create a new React Native project:
```bash
npx react-native init FinancialTracker
```
4. Follow the official [React Native Environment Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
